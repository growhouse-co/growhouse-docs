# Authentication

Growhouse MCP supports two authentication methods:

| Method | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **OAuth 2.1** | Browser-based sign-in. Used by Claude and other MCP clients automatically. |
| **API Key** | Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Create in Settings. |

---

## API Keys

### Create a key

1. Go to [app.growhouse.co](https://app.growhouse.co) > **Settings**
2. **Account > MCP Keys** for user-scoped keys (access all your workspaces)
3. **Workspace > MCP** for workspace-scoped keys (access one workspace)
4. Click **Create Key**, copy it immediately

### Use the key

Include it as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mcp.growhouse.co \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mcp_sk_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

All API keys start with `mcp_sk_`.

### Manage keys

- **Revoke**: Settings > find the key > delete
- **Rotate**: Create a new key, update your client, delete the old one
- **Last used**: Visible in Settings so you can find stale keys

## OAuth 2.1

OAuth is handled automatically by MCP clients like Claude. You don't need to configure anything — just connect via `https://mcp.growhouse.co` and approve access in your browser.

### How it works

1. Your AI client redirects you to Growhouse to sign in
2. You approve the requested permissions
3. Growhouse issues a token pair (access + refresh)
4. Tokens refresh automatically — no manual intervention

### Scopes

| Scope | Grants |
|-------|--------|
| `canvas:read` | View canvases and elements |
| `canvas:write` | Create, update, and delete elements |
| `workspace:read` | View workspace info |

### Technical details

- **PKCE**: Required (S256 only)
- **Token lifetime**: ~1 hour, auto-refreshed
- **Refresh tokens**: Single-use with rotation
- **Server metadata**: `https://mcp.growhouse.co/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- **Dynamic client registration**: Supported (RFC 7591)

## Security

- Keys are SHA-256 hashed at rest — Growhouse never stores raw keys
- OAuth tokens are short-lived with automatic rotation
- All connections require HTTPS
- Rate limiting applies per workspace (100 requests/minute)
