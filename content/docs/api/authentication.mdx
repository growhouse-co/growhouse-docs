# Authentication

The Growhouse API uses API keys for authentication.

## Getting an API Key

1. Log in to [app.growhouse.co](https://app.growhouse.co)
2. Go to **Workspace Settings**
3. Click **API Keys** in the sidebar
4. Click **Create API Key**
5. Give it a name and select permissions
6. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.growhouse.co/v1/workspaces" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Key Permissions

When creating a key, you can scope its permissions:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `read:workspaces` | View workspace info |
| `write:workspaces` | Create/update workspaces |
| `read:canvases` | View canvases |
| `write:canvases` | Create/update canvases |
| `delete:canvases` | Delete canvases |

## Security Best Practices

### Do

- Store keys in environment variables
- Use separate keys for different applications
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use minimum required permissions

### Don't

- Commit keys to version control
- Share keys between team members
- Use production keys in development
- Expose keys in client-side code

## Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to **Workspace Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Create a new key
5. Update your applications
