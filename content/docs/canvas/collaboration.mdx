# Real-time Collaboration

Growhouse enables seamless collaboration with your team on shared canvases.

## Live Cursors

See where your teammates are working in real-time:

- Each collaborator has a unique cursor color
- Cursor shows their name on hover
- See what they're selecting and editing

## Simultaneous Editing

Multiple people can edit the same canvas:

- Changes sync instantly across all viewers
- No conflicts - each person works independently
- Automatic save ensures nothing is lost

## Editing Locks

When someone is editing a text element:

- The element shows a lock indicator
- Others can see it's being edited
- Lock releases automatically when done

## Per-User Undo/Redo

Each collaborator has their own undo history:

- Your undo won't affect others' changes
- Redo your own actions independently
- Full history preserved per user

## Presence Indicators

See who's currently viewing the canvas:

- Avatar stack in the top bar
- Green dot indicates active users
- Click to see full participant list
