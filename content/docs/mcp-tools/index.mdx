# MCP Tools

Growhouse exposes your canvases to AI assistants via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP client can read, create, and edit canvas elements.

**Server URL**: `https://mcp.growhouse.co`

### Read

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `list_canvases` | List all canvases you have access to |
| `get_canvas_overview` | Element counts, bounds, who's online |
| `find_elements` | Search by type, content, location |
| `get_element_details` | Full content, styles, position |

### Write

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `create_element` | Add sticky notes or rich text |
| `create_media_element` | Add images, videos, social embeds |
| `update_element` | Change content, position, or styles |
| `delete_element` | Remove an element |

### Intelligence

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `get_clusters` | AI spatial analysis — detect moodboards, sequences, comparisons |
| `get_collaboration_status` | Who's online, what's locked, cursor positions |
| `resolve_natural_ref` | Convert `sticky-top-left-1` to a UUID |

## Element Types

| Type | Format | Use for |
|------|--------|---------|
| `sticky` | Plain text | Quick notes, brainstorming |
| `text-element` | Tiptap JSON | Formatted text, paragraphs |
| `media` | URL | Images (.jpg, .png, .gif), videos (.mp4) |
| `embed` | URL | YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Loom |

## Natural References

Reference elements by position instead of UUID:

```
sticky-top-left-1      → First sticky in the top-left area
text-element-center-2  → Second text element in center
media-bottom-right-1   → First media in bottom-right
```

Use `resolve_natural_ref` to get the UUID when you need it.

---

## Positioning

| Method | Example | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Quadrant | `"top-left"` | Places in that canvas region |
| Near element | `"sticky-top-left-1"` | 50px to the right of that element |
| Exact | `{x: 100, y: 200}` | Pixel coordinates |

## Collaboration Safety

Every read tool can include collaboration context:
- Who's viewing the canvas
- Which elements are locked (someone is editing)
- Which elements are selected by others

This prevents your AI from overwriting someone's in-progress work.

## Examples

**Add notes**:
```
"Add a sticky with 'Q1 Goals' in the top-left, then three more below with our priorities"
```

**Curate media**:
```
"Add this YouTube video to the moodboard section"
```

**Analyze a canvas**:
```
"What themes do you see on this canvas?"
```

**Safe editing**:
```
"Update the sticky that no one else is working on"
```
