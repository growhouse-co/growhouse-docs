# MCP Tools

Growhouse provides MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that allow AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and others to interact with your canvases.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. With Growhouse MCP tools, AI assistants can:

- **Read canvas content** - Access elements, text, and structure
- **Create elements** - Add new content to canvases
- **Update elements** - Modify existing content
- **Search canvases** - Find specific content across your workspace

## Available Tools

### Canvas MCP Server

The Growhouse Canvas MCP server provides these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_canvases` | List all canvases in a workspace |
| `get_canvas_overview` | Get summary of a canvas |
| `find_elements` | Search for elements by type or content |
| `get_element_details` | Get full details of an element |
| `create_element` | Create a new element |
| `update_element` | Update an existing element |
| `delete_element` | Remove an element |

## Use Cases

### Content Generation

Ask your AI assistant to create content directly on your canvas:

```
"Add a heading 'Q1 Goals' and three bullet points underneath"
```

### Content Review

Have AI review and analyze your canvas content:

```
"Summarize all the text elements on this canvas"
```

### Automation

Build workflows that automatically update canvases based on triggers.
