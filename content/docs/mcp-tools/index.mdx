# MCP Tools

Growhouse provides MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that allow AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and others to interact with your canvases in real-time.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. With Growhouse MCP tools, AI assistants can:

- **Read canvas content** - Access elements, text, and spatial structure
- **Create elements** - Add sticky notes, text, images, videos, and social embeds
- **Update elements** - Modify content, position, and styling
- **Understand context** - AI-powered clustering detects moodboards, sequences, and relationships
- **Collaborate safely** - Real-time awareness of other users editing

## Available Tools

### Core Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_canvases` | List all canvases with MCP access enabled |
| `get_canvas_overview` | Get summary with element counts, bounds, and collaboration status |
| `find_elements` | Search by type, content, location, or collaboration status |
| `get_element_details` | Get full details including content, styles, and context |

### Content Creation

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_element` | Create sticky notes or rich text elements |
| `create_media_element` | Add images, videos, or social embeds (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.) |
| `update_element` | Modify content, position, or styles |
| `delete_element` | Remove an element from canvas |

### Intelligence & Collaboration

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_clusters` | AI spatial analysis - detect moodboards, comparisons, sequences |
| `get_collaboration_status` | Real-time info on online users, cursors, selections, locks |
| `resolve_natural_ref` | Convert human-readable refs like "sticky-top-left-1" to UUIDs |

## Element Types

### Editable Elements

| Type | Content Format | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `sticky` | Plain text | Quick notes, brainstorming, ideas |
| `text-element` | Tiptap JSON | Formatted text, paragraphs, rich content |

### Media Elements (via `create_media_element`)

| Type | Supported Sources |
|------|-------------------|
| `media` | Direct image/video URLs (.jpg, .png, .gif, .mp4) |
| `embed` | YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Loom |

## Natural References

Instead of UUIDs, you can reference elements using human-readable IDs:

```
sticky-top-left-1      → First sticky in top-left quadrant
text-element-center-2  → Second text element in center
media-bottom-right-1   → First media in bottom-right
```

Use `resolve_natural_ref` to convert these to UUIDs when needed.

## Smart Positioning

When creating or finding elements, use smart positioning:

| Option | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `quadrant` | `"top-left"` | Position in canvas region |
| `near_element` | `"sticky-top-left-1"` | Place 50px right of another element |
| `x, y` | `{x: 100, y: 200}` | Exact coordinates |

## Real-Time Collaboration

All read tools support `collaboration_context` to see:
- Who is online viewing the canvas
- Which elements are locked for editing
- Which elements are selected by others
- Cursor positions of collaborators

This prevents conflicts when AI and humans work together.

## Use Cases

### Content Generation
```
"Add a sticky note with 'Q1 Goals' in the top-left,
then add three more stickies below it with our priorities"
```

### Media Curation
```
"Add this YouTube video to the moodboard section"
"Embed these Instagram posts near the inspiration cluster"
```

### Canvas Analysis
```
"Analyze this canvas and tell me what themes you see"
"What are the main clusters and how do they relate?"
```

### Safe Collaboration
```
"Show me which elements are available to edit right now"
"Update the sticky that no one else is working on"
```
