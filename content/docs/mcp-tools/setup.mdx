# MCP Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect Growhouse MCP tools to your AI assistant.

## Prerequisites

- A Growhouse account with API access
- An MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Get Your API Key

1. Go to **Workspace Settings** in Growhouse
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the key (you won't see it again)

## Configure Your MCP Client

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "growhouse": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@growhouse/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GROWHOUSE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "growhouse": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@growhouse/mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "GROWHOUSE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify Connection

Once configured, your AI assistant should have access to Growhouse tools. Try asking:

```
"List my Growhouse canvases"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Server not found" error

- Ensure you have Node.js installed (v18+)
- Check your API key is correct
- Restart your AI client

### "Unauthorized" error

- Verify your API key is active
- Check the key has the required permissions
- Ensure you're accessing the correct workspace

## Security Notes

- Never share your API key
- Use environment variables, not hardcoded values
- Rotate keys periodically
- Revoke unused keys in workspace settings
