# Connect to Growhouse

Growhouse runs a remote MCP server at `https://mcp.growhouse.co`. Connect it to Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP-compatible client.

Two ways to connect:

| Method | Best for | Setup time |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **OAuth** | Claude (claude.ai, Claude Code) | 30 seconds |
| **API Key** | Any MCP client | 2 minutes |

---

## Option A: OAuth (Claude)

The fastest way. Claude handles everything.

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop

1. Open **Settings > MCP Servers** in Claude
2. Add server URL: `https://mcp.growhouse.co`
3. Click **Connect** — you'll be redirected to Growhouse to sign in and approve
4. Done. Claude now has access to your canvases.

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add growhouse --url https://mcp.growhouse.co
```

Claude Code will open your browser to complete authorization.

---

## Option B: API Key

Works with any MCP client. You create a key in Growhouse and add it to your client's config.

### 1. Create an API key

1. Open [app.growhouse.co](https://app.growhouse.co) and go to **Settings**
2. Under **Account > MCP Keys**, click **Create Key**
3. Copy the key immediately — you won't see it again

<Callout type="info">
User API keys grant access to all your workspaces. For workspace-scoped keys, go to **Settings > Workspace > MCP**.
</Callout>

### 2. Add to your MCP client

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add growhouse --url https://mcp.growhouse.co --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Or add to `~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "growhouse": {
      "url": "https://mcp.growhouse.co",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "growhouse": {
      "url": "https://mcp.growhouse.co",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor / Windsurf / Other

Same pattern — add as a remote MCP server with URL `https://mcp.growhouse.co` and the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

### 3. Verify

Ask your AI assistant:

```
List my Growhouse canvases
```

You should see your canvases listed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" or 401 error

- Check your API key is correct and not revoked
- Make sure the `Authorization` header is `Bearer YOUR_KEY` (with the space)
- Try creating a new key

### "No canvases found"

- Enable MCP access for your canvases in **Settings > Workspace > MCP > Canvas AI Access**
- By default, all canvases are accessible — but you may have toggled some off

### OAuth flow not completing

- Make sure you're logged in to Growhouse before approving
- If the flow gets stuck, close the tab and retry from your AI client
- Check that pop-ups aren't blocked

---

## Security

- API keys are hashed — Growhouse never stores the raw key
- Rotate keys anytime in Settings
- Revoke compromised keys immediately
- OAuth tokens auto-expire and refresh automatically
