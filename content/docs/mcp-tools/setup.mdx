# Connect to Growhouse

Growhouse runs a remote MCP server at `https://mcp.growhouse.co`. Connect it to Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP-compatible client.

## OAuth (recommended)

If your client supports OAuth — Claude does — just point it at the server URL. No keys needed.

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop

1. Open **Settings > MCP Servers** in Claude
2. Add server URL: `https://mcp.growhouse.co`
3. Click **Connect** — sign in to Growhouse and approve
4. Done.

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add growhouse --url https://mcp.growhouse.co
```

Claude Code opens your browser to authorize. After you approve, it's connected.

### Cursor / Windsurf

Add `https://mcp.growhouse.co` as a remote MCP server. If the client supports OAuth, it will handle authorization automatically.

## API Key (headless / no OAuth)

For clients that don't support OAuth, or automated environments without a browser.

### 1. Create a key

1. Open [app.growhouse.co](https://app.growhouse.co) > **Settings**
2. **Account > MCP Keys** — creates a key for all your workspaces
3. Copy it immediately — you won't see it again

<Callout type="info">
For workspace-scoped keys (one workspace only), go to **Settings > Workspace > MCP**.
</Callout>

### 2. Configure your client

Add as a remote MCP server with the key in the `Authorization` header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "growhouse": {
      "url": "https://mcp.growhouse.co",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Where this file lives depends on your client:
- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`
- **Claude Desktop**: `claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Cursor**: MCP settings in the IDE

### 3. Verify

Ask your AI assistant:

```
List my Growhouse canvases
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" or 401

- If using an API key: check it's correct and not revoked
- If using OAuth: try disconnecting and reconnecting from your client

### "No canvases found"

- Check **Settings > Workspace > MCP > Canvas AI Access** — canvases must have MCP enabled
- All canvases are enabled by default, but you may have toggled some off

### OAuth flow not completing

- Make sure you're logged in to Growhouse before approving
- If it gets stuck, close the tab and retry from your AI client
- Check that pop-ups aren't blocked

## Security

- API keys are SHA-256 hashed — Growhouse never stores the raw key
- OAuth tokens auto-expire and refresh automatically
- Rotate or revoke keys anytime in Settings
